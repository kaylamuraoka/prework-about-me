      <p>I am a new college graduate of Santa Clara University with a BSc in Management 
      Information Systems and BA in Japanese area studies. Since graduating 
      in August, I have been working on enhancing my coding skills by watching video tutorials and 
      reading blogs and am eager to continue strengthening my coding ability so that I may secure a 
      web developemnt position in the future.</p>

      <p>I am an amateur home baker, travel enthusiast, dark chocolate connoisseur, who loves talking all things Japanese. 
      I crave adventure, whether it be exploring new places or learning about exciting foreign cultures. When I am not traveling or in the kitchen, I love a good board game and murder mystery movie.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It was through my technical management information systems coursework that I discovered my 
      passion for web development, programming languages, and database development. Since graduating

      boundless creativity and freedom that building something completely from scratch allows and I have 
      fallen in love with.</p>
